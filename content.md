# On Our Titles
> Take the path of life in a way in which you do not allow yourself to be named in ways which are too small for yourself. 
> <br><br>
> David Whyte

???
> You don't give yourself too easy a defintion. You don't give those around you too easy a definition. You leave the mystery of where you are about to arrive to the actual physical sense of arrival and revelation itself.

# What is Data?
--

+ Data is a collection of facts about something that's happened
--

+ Can be numbers, words, measurements, observations, or  descriptions
--


## Data can be anything and doesn't have to fit into a spreadsheet

---
# What is Data?
--

+ Can describe what happened either directly or indirectly
--

+ Example: morning food vending machine sales as a measurement of students coming to school hungry
--


## Know what your data is measuring

# Final Thoughts
> Numbers speak to our head, stories speak to our heart. When data tells a true and compelling story, we bring heart and head together in order to create action.
